# DrawDiagram
this code can draw diagram by data from array
just use my class DiagramsFrame and method drawFrame(ArrayList<ArrayList<Double>>) which takes array of array of values x and y your graph
for example

you have graph of function f(x) = x this mean that you have array of x [0,1,2,3...] and array of y in this case it will [0,1,2,3...] .
generally, array of y [f(x1),f(x2),f(x3),...]
